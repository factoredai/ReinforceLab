# Reinforcement Learning Unresolved Homeworks and Quizzes

This folder contains unresolved homeworks and quizzes from the Reinforcement Learning Coursera Specialization. The purpose of this folder is to provide a resource for people who are interested in learning the topics covered in the specialization but cannot afford to enroll in the course.

Please note that these homeworks and quizzes are intended for self-study and are not officially graded by Coursera. They may contain errors or may not cover all the topics covered in the course. Therefore, they should be used as a supplementary resource to the official course materials and should not be relied upon as the sole source of learning.

## Usage

Quizzes are provided as markdown files, and contain the answers in a hidden block. Please try to answer each question in your head before revealing the answer. For homeworks, we provide the notebook given by Coursera. Please download it or open it on google colab to complete them.

## Contributing

If you find any errors or have any suggestions for improving these homeworks and quizzes, please feel free to contribute to this repository by submitting a pull request. Your contributions will help make this resource more useful for others.
