Demo of loading content from another file.

This checkpoint file demonstrates how to include additional files in your submission.
You can replace this with your actual model weights, configuration, or any other data
your agent needs to load.

For example, you might save:
- PyTorch model weights (.pt, .pth)
- TensorFlow checkpoints
- Numpy arrays (.npy)
- JSON configuration files
- Pickle files with trained parameters
